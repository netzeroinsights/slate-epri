# Introduction

Our REST APIs give all the functionalities needed to interact with our database. All these services are exclusively usable with https standard, and only after having been authenticated.

For brevity, the possible error codes for all the calls are at the bottom of the document.

Every endpoint is to be called starting with the domain https://api.netzeroinsights.com

For testing purposes, we have a sandbox available at https://20.108.20.67

# Security

## Login

> To login, use this code:

```shell
curl -v -X POST "https://api.netzeroinsights.com/security/formLogin" \
-H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
-d "username=YOUR_USERNAME&password=YOUR_PASSWORD"
```

> Make sure to replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_PASSWORD` with your credentials.
> 
> Using the -v ("verbose") flag lets you see the full response, in which you can find the **Session Cookie**.

Before using any other API, you should first login using the following endpoint:

`POST /security/formLogin`

With the following two parameters:

| Parameter name | Parameter value               |
|----------------|-------------------------------|
| username       | provided by Net Zero Insights |
| password       | provided by Net Zero Insights |

The possible response codes are:

| Response code | Meaning          |
|---------------|------------------|
| 200           | Login successful |

Please note that in case of a 200 response, you will also get a **Session Cookie**. You should save this,
as it will be needed for using all the other endpoints. The session cookie expires after 30 minutes of
session inactivity.

Our API expects the **Session Cookie** to be included in all API requests to the server, like this:

`JSESSIONID=EXAMPLE_SESSION_ID`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>EXAMPLE_SESSION_ID</code> with your **Session Cookie**.
</aside>

## Logout

> To logout, use this code:

```shell
curl -v --cookie "JSESSIONID=EXAMPLE_SESSION_ID" \
 -X GET "https://api.netzeroinsights.com/security/logout"
```

> Make sure to replace `EXAMPLE_SESSION_ID` with your **Session Cookie**

To close the session, you should use the following endpoint:

`GET /security/logout`

It takes no parameter, and has the following response code:

| Response code | Meaning            |
|---------------|--------------------|
| 200           | Session terminated |

<aside class="notice">
Please note that manually closing a session is not required, since it will be closed bye the server after
30 minutes. This endpoint is mainly used if you need to use different accounts.
</aside>

# Sending companies to be processed

> To request the processing of a list of companies, use this code:

```shell
curl -v --cookie 'JSESSIONID=EXAMPLE_SESSION_ID' \
-X POST 'https://api.netzeroinsights.com/epri/process' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \                 
-d '{"companies":[{"id":"13579","name":"Net Zero Insights","website":"netzeroinsights.com","linkedIn":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/netzeroinsights","text":"Some example text"},{"id":"24680","name":"Example company","website":"example.com","linkedIn":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/example","text":"Some example text"}]}'
```

To request the processing of a list of companies you should use the following endpoint:

`POST /epri/process`

With a JSON request body in the format specified at the section [Company Processing Payload](#company-processing-payload).

The possible response codes are:

| Response code | Meaning            |
|---------------|--------------------|

<aside class="notice">
Please note that you should send at least one between website, linkedIn and text, otherwise it will be very hard (if not impossible) to correctly process the company.
</aside>

# Taxonomy Page

Our taxonomy is a way to visualise the relation between different topics.

## All Taxonomy Items

> To get all Taxonomy Graph Items, use this code:

```shell
curl -v --cookie 'JSESSIONID=EXAMPLE_SESSION_ID' \
-X GET 'https://api.netzeroinsights.com/taxonomy/itemDtos' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \                 
```

> In case of a 200 response, the response body will contain all the available items, with the JSON structured like the following:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "label": "Alternative Fuel",
    "description": "Alternative fuels are at the forefront of innovation, with notable examples being biofuels and synthetic fuels. Solutions in this domain are dedicated to advancing and applying these alternatives, not only for transportation but also for broader energy applications, including electricity generation and industrial processes."
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "label": "Biofuel",
    "description": "Biofuels are produced from renewable resources, primarily plant-based feedstocks such as crops, agricultural residues, or algae. Biofuels offer a way to decarbonize sectors that are challenging to electrify, such as aviation and heavy industry, while promoting agricultural sustainability through responsible feedstock sourcing and land-use practices. Some solutions include innovative processes to convert biomass into biofuels, such as biodiesel and bioethanol, through techniques like fermentation and thermochemical conversion."
  }
]
```

To get all the taxonomy items you should use the following endpoint:

`GET /taxonomy/itemDtos`

| Response code | Meaning            |
|---------------|--------------------|
| 200           | Request successful |

## Level 0 Taxonomy Graph Items

> To get Taxonomy Graph Item list without any parents (which means they are the top level of our taxonomy), use this code:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 347,
    "label": "Solutions map",
    "description": "The Solutions Map simplifies your exploration of climate tech solutions. We've categorized over 200 solutions into Challenge Areas like Energy, Industry, Transport, and more. When you choose a solution, you can dive into its sub-solutions if they exist. You can also access insights, active investors, and information about startups and SMEs for each solution.",
    "hasChildren": true
  },
  {
    "id": 660,
    "label": "Software map",
    "description": "The Software Map is a comprehensive visual representation that outlines the diverse array of software solutions within the climate tech landscape. This map provides a detailed overview of software applications tailored to address climate challenges across various sectors, including energy, transport, industry, food and agriculture, built environment, natural environment, and more. ",

```json
[
  {
    "id": 5,
    "label": "Bioethanol",
    "description": "Bioethanol is produced through the fermentation of organic materials, such as crops like corn, and sugarcane, or cellulose-rich feedstocks like switchgrass. This process converts the sugars within these materials into ethanol using microorganisms. Bioethanol is a key player in the quest for sustainable transportation fuels, as it can be blended with gasoline to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on fossil fuels. When compared to other sustainable fuels like biodiesel or synthetic fuels, bioethanol has specific advantages, such as its compatibility with existing gasoline engines and infrastructure.",
    "hasChildren": false
  },
  {
    "id": 6,
    "label": "Bio-Oil",
    "description": "Bio-oil is produced from biomass sources like wood chips, agricultural residues, or algae. It is typically created through a process called pyrolysis or fast pyrolysis, which involves heating biomass in the absence of oxygen to break it down into a liquid form. Bio-oil can be used as a replacement for traditional fossil fuels in applications such as power generation and heating, and it can also serve as a feedstock for the production of biofuels and other valuable chemicals. Compared to other sustainable fuels like bioethanol or biodiesel, bio-oil offers advantages such as a higher energy density and the potential for versatile applications.",
