# Introduction

Our REST APIs give all the functionalities needed to interact with our database. All these services are exclusively usable with https standard, and only after having been authenticated.

For brevity, the possible error codes for all the calls are at the bottom of the document.

Every endpoint is to be called starting with the domain https://api.netzeroinsights.com

# Security

## Login

> To login, use this code:

```shell
curl -v -X POST "https://api.netzeroinsights.com/security/formLogin" \
-H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
-d "username=YOUR_USERNAME&password=YOUR_PASSWORD"
```

> Make sure to replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_PASSWORD` with your credentials.
> 
> Using the -v ("verbose") flag lets you see the full response, in which you can find the **Session Cookie**.

Before using any other API, you should first login using the following endpoint:

`POST /security/formLogin`

With the following two parameters:

| Parameter name | Parameter value               |
|----------------|-------------------------------|
| username       | provided by Net Zero Insights |
| password       | provided by Net Zero Insights |

The possible response codes are:

| Response code | Meaning          |
|---------------|------------------|
| 200           | Login successful |

Please note that in case of a 200 response, you will also get a **Session Cookie**. You should save this,
as it will be needed for using all the other endpoints. The session cookie expires after 30 minutes of
session inactivity.

Our API expects the **Session Cookie** to be included in all API requests to the server, like this:

`JSESSIONID=EXAMPLE_SESSION_ID`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>EXAMPLE_SESSION_ID</code> with your **Session Cookie**.
</aside>

## Logout

> To logout, use this code:

```shell
curl -v --cookie "JSESSIONID=EXAMPLE_SESSION_ID" \
 -X GET "https://api.netzeroinsights.com/security/logout"
```

> Make sure to replace `EXAMPLE_SESSION_ID` with your **Session Cookie**

To close the session, you should use the following endpoint:

`GET /security/logout`

It takes no parameter, and has the following response code:

| Response code | Meaning            |
|---------------|--------------------|
| 200           | Session terminated |

<aside class="notice">
Please note that manually closing a session is not required, since it will be closed bye the server after
30 minutes. This endpoint is mainly used if you need to use different accounts.
</aside>

# Startup List

> To get startup list, use this code:

```shell
curl -v --cookie 'JSESSIONID=EXAMPLE_SESSION_ID' \
-X POST 'https://api.netzeroinsights.com/getStartupList' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \                 
-d '{"limit": 1, "offset": 0, "include":{}, "exclude": {}, "fundingRoundInclude":{}, "fundingRoundExclude": {}, "investorInclude":{}, "investorExclude": {}, "sorting": {}}'
```

> In case of a 200 response, the response body will contain all the startups matching your request, with the format specified at section [Startup Search](#startup-search).

Innovative technology: Sunfire offers modular power plants and electrolysis systems to produce renewable energy, hydrogen and syngas. Provider of energy conversion technologies, including solid oxide fuel cells and renewable synthetic fuels based on solid oxide electrolyzers. Sunfire is an electrolysis company that designs and manufactures systems for the production of renewable industrial gas and fuel. A World Without Fossil Fuels. Sunfire develops and markets efficient energy supply concepts, which focus on the transformation of regenerative power into liquid petrol (power-to-liquids) or gas (power-to-gas). Develops and produces high-temperature fuel cells which facilitate the generation of electric power and heat. Developer of industrial electrolyzers designed to convert renewable electrical energy into fuels and gases. The company's renewable hydrogen and syngas as substitutes for fossil energy sources and offer electrolyzers based on alkaline and solid oxide (SOEC) technologies, enabling chemical, fuel, and steel industries to transform of energy Established in 2010 and based in Dresden, Germany, Sunfire is a world-leading industrial electrolysis company with two differentiated technologies. We develop and manufacture electrolyzers based on SOEC and Alkaline technologies that enable a truly sustainable and cost-effective production of renewable hydrogen, syngas and e-Fuel.\n\nSunfire has been named Global Cleantech 100 company for six consecutive years and is backed by leading strategic and financial investors such as Neste and SMS Group  global leaders in the renewable fuel and steel business. With more than 500 employees located in Germany and Switzerland and a well-established partner network, we realize large electrolysis projects to deliver on our promise: Creating a world without fossil fuels! Sunfire develops and manufactures systems for renewable industrial gas and fuel production. These substitutes for mineral oil and natural gas, known as e-Gas, e-Fuel or e-Chemicals, replace fossil fuels in existing infrastructures. The solid oxide cells (SOCs) used for the conversion process are also used as generators to provide electricity and heat.\n\nSunfires vision is to make regenerative energy from sources such as wind farms, hydropower plants, and photovoltaic systems available wherever and whenever it is needed  not just when the wind is blowing, the waves are crashing or the sun is shining.

Sunfire develops and produces high temperature electrolyzers SOEC and high temperature fuel cells SOFC . As water vapour is used in electrolysis efficiencies of up to H methane and about for fuels are achieved.Customer ProblemTarget groups are energy chemical refinery and utility companies. Energy suppliers can work on a more efficient supply at certain points as the fuel cells can also use hydrocarbons.Business ModelSunfire offers its technology in the fields of CHP off grid production and hydrogen fuels. The product is then sold directly for individual orders.USPIn niche markets the special requirements and simpler logistics can give this system an economic advantage. Sunfire s entry markets are therefore small gas customers off grid applications and CHP plants for real estate.",

Biofuels offer a way to decarbonize sectors that are challenging to electrify, such as aviation and heavy industry, while promoting agricultural sustainability through responsible feedstock sourcing and land-use practices. Some solutions include innovative processes to convert biomass into biofuels, such as biodiesel and bioethanol, through techniques like fermentation and thermochemical conversion.",
