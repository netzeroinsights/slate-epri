# Introduction

Our REST APIs give all the functionalities needed to interact with our database. All these services are exclusively usable with https standard, and only after having been authenticated.

For brevity, the possible error codes for all the calls are at the bottom of the document.

Every endpoint is to be called starting with the domain https://api.netzeroinsights.com

For testing purposes, we have a sandbox available at https://20.108.20.67

# Security

## Login

> To login, use this code:

```shell
curl -v -X POST "https://api.netzeroinsights.com/security/formLogin" \
-H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
-d "username=YOUR_USERNAME&password=YOUR_PASSWORD"
```

> Make sure to replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_PASSWORD` with your credentials.
> 
> Using the -v ("verbose") flag lets you see the full response, in which you can find the **Session Cookie**.

Before using any other API, you should first login using the following endpoint:

`POST /security/formLogin`

With the following two parameters:

| Parameter name | Parameter value               |
|----------------|-------------------------------|
| username       | provided by Net Zero Insights |
| password       | provided by Net Zero Insights |

The possible response codes are:

| Response code | Meaning          |
|---------------|------------------|
| 200           | Login successful |

Please note that in case of a 200 response, you will also get a **Session Cookie**. You should save this,
as it will be needed for using all the other endpoints. The session cookie expires after 30 minutes of
session inactivity.

Our API expects the **Session Cookie** to be included in all API requests to the server, like this:

`JSESSIONID=EXAMPLE_SESSION_ID`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>EXAMPLE_SESSION_ID</code> with your **Session Cookie**.
</aside>

## Logout

> To logout, use this code:

```shell
curl -v --cookie "JSESSIONID=EXAMPLE_SESSION_ID" \
 -X GET "https://api.netzeroinsights.com/security/logout"
```

> Make sure to replace `EXAMPLE_SESSION_ID` with your **Session Cookie**

To close the session, you should use the following endpoint:

`GET /security/logout`

It takes no parameter, and has the following response code:

| Response code | Meaning            |
|---------------|--------------------|
| 200           | Session terminated |

<aside class="notice">
Please note that manually closing a session is not required, since it will be closed bye the server after
30 minutes. This endpoint is mainly used if you need to use different accounts.
</aside>

# Sending companies to be processed

> To request the processing of a list of companies, use this code:

```shell
curl -v --cookie 'JSESSIONID=EXAMPLE_SESSION_ID' \
-X POST 'https://api.netzeroinsights.com/epri/process' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \                 
-d '{"companies":[{"id":"13579","name":"Net Zero Insights","website":"netzeroinsights.com"},{"id":"24680","name":"Example company","website":"example.com"}]}'
```

To request the processing of a list of companies you should use the following endpoint:

`POST /epri/process`

With a JSON request body in the format specified at the section [Company Processing Payload](#company-processing-payload).

The possible response codes are:

| Response code | Meaning            |
|---------------|--------------------|

This process converts the sugars within these materials into ethanol using microorganisms. Bioethanol is a key player in the quest for sustainable transportation fuels, as it can be blended with gasoline to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on fossil fuels. When compared to other sustainable fuels like biodiesel or synthetic fuels, bioethanol has specific advantages, such as its compatibility with existing gasoline engines and infrastructure.",

  },
  {
    "label": "Bio-Oil",
    "description": "Bio-oil is produced from biomass sources like wood chips, agricultural residues, or algae. It is typically created through a process called pyrolysis or fast pyrolysis, which involves heating biomass in the absence of oxygen to break it down into a liquid form. Bio-oil can be used as a replacement for traditional fossil fuels in applications such as power generation and heating, and it can also serve as a feedstock for the production of biofuels and other valuable chemicals. Compared to other sustainable fuels like bioethanol or biodiesel, bio-oil offers advantages such as a higher energy density and the potential for versatile applications.",
